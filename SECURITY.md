## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to Shadway, please follow these security guidelines:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Never hardcode credentials or API keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper session management
- Validate user permissions on all protected routes
- Use HTTPS in production

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate data on both client and server side
- Prevent SQL/NoSQL injection attacks
- Protect against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Implement CSRF protection

### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper access controls
- Never expose database credentials in code
- Regularly backup database
- Monitor for suspicious activities

### API Security
- Rate limit API endpoints
- Implement proper authentication
- Validate all request data
- Use secure headers
- Log API access for monitoring

### Dependencies
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use `npm audit` to check for known issues
- Remove unused dependencies

### Code Security
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- Implement proper error handling
- Use secure randomness for tokens
- Sanitize file uploads
- Validate URLs before redirects

## Security Measures We Implement

### Infrastructure
- HTTPS encryption for all traffic
- Secure database connections
- Environment variable management
- Regular security updates

### Application
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Rate limiting on API routes
- Secure session management

### Monitoring
- Error tracking and logging
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is reported:

1. **Confirmation**: We confirm the vulnerability and its severity
2. **Fix Development**: We develop a fix in a private repository
3. **Testing**: We thoroughly test the fix
4. **Release**: We release a patch version
5. **Disclosure**: We publish a security advisory with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Affected versions
   - Patches available
   - Credit to the reporter
   - Mitigation steps

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate patch release
- **High**: Patch within 7 days
- **Medium**: Patch within 30 days
- **Low**: Included in next regular release

## Third-Party Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in a third-party dependency:

1. Report it to the maintainer of that package
2. Notify us so we can track and update when patched
3. We will monitor the issue and update dependencies accordingly
